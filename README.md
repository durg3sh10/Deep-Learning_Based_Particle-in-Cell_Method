# Deep-Learning_Based_Particle-in-Cell_Method

• Devised a method for incorporating Deep Learning based charge depo-
sition into the Particle-in-Cell Method in context of negative ion source (ROBIN).
• We compare the accuracy and the performance of the DL-based PIC
method with the traditional PIC method.
